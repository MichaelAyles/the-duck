Please work to todo.md
After implementing a feature or ticking off a job on todo, perform the following workflow
run npm run workflow
if it passes, you may commit to your working branch, not main.
after committing to the working branch on github, check the status of the commit using github actions, where it will test the validation workflow.
if the todo list is empty, perform a code review to confirm all is good.

Commit and push after every single job completion.
