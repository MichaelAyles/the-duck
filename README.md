## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

This project is built with a strong, opinionated architectural philosophy that prioritizes **simplicity, type-safety, and developer experience**.

1.  **Type-Safety End-to-End**: The primary goal is to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors. We use TypeScript everywhere. Supabase provides auto-generated types from our database schema, ensuring that the data shape is consistent from the database query all the way to the React component that renders it.

2.  **Server-Centric Logic**: We leverage the Next.js App Router to its full potential. Business logic, data fetching, and mutations are handled on the server via **API Routes** and **Server Actions**. The client is responsible for presenting the UI and sending requests, not for complex data orchestration.

3.  **Thin, Composable Components**: React components are kept as "dumb" as possible. They receive data and functions via props. The "smarts" are encapsulated in custom **React Hooks** (`/src/hooks`). This makes components highly reusable and easy to reason about. The `ChatLayout` component acts as the orchestrator, managing state and passing it down to its children.

4.  **Simplicity First State Management**: We intentionally avoid complex global state management libraries. State is managed locally with React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`). This avoids unnecessary overhead and keeps the data flow predictable: state is owned by the highest-level component that needs it and passed down.

5.  **Managed Backend (BaaS)**: We use **Supabase** for our database, authentication, and file storage. This choice aligns with the "keep it simple" ethos. It provides a robust, scalable, and secure backend without the overhead of managing our own database infrastructure, allowing us to focus on building features.

This approach results in a codebase that is not only performant and secure but also a pleasure to work on.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Details

### **Modular Hook-Based Design**
The application implements a clean separation of concerns through focused React hooks:

- **`useChatSession`**: Manages session lifecycle, message loading, and welcome messages
- **`useMessageHandling`**: Handles message sending, streaming responses, and error states
- **`useChatSettings`**: Manages user preferences, model selection, and configuration
- **`useChatLifecycle`**: Controls chat ending, inactivity handling, and cleanup operations

### **Security Architecture**
The application follows a **Security-First** design philosophy:

1. **API Boundary Enforcement**: All database operations go through authenticated API routes
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers including auth checks, rate limiting, and input validation
3. **Zero Trust Model**: Every API endpoint independently validates authentication
4. **Row-Level Security**: Additional database-level protection for user data isolation

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Streaming Responses**: Server-Sent Events for real-time AI responses
- **Proper Memoization**: React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Centralized Configuration**: Reduces bundle size and improves maintainability
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Planned for future releases to improve perceived performance

### **Known Limitations & Future Improvements**

**Current Limitations:**
- State synchronization challenges with distributed hook architecture
- Some performance optimizations missing (virtualization, pagination)
- Integration and E2E test coverage could be expanded

**Recent Improvements (January 2025):**
- ‚úÖ **Append-Only Database Architecture**: Eliminates data loss with robust message persistence
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Token Limits**: Increased to 16,000 tokens per request for complex conversations
- ‚úÖ **Resizable DuckPond Windows**: Intelligent sizing with manual resize controls
- ‚úÖ **DuckPond Artifact Detection**: Automatically finds and restores interactive content from saved chats
- ‚úÖ **Flow Mode Integration**: Renamed from Memory Mode with improved chat sidebar behavior
- ‚úÖ **Performance Optimizations**: Fixed race conditions and improved loading animations
- ‚úÖ **Redis-based Rate Limiting**: Production-ready scalability for serverless deployment
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: 93 unit tests covering critical application paths
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Model Selector**: Advanced sorting, filtering, and realistic pricing estimates

**Planned Future Improvements:**
- Implement centralized state management (Zustand/Jotai)
- Add virtualization for message lists and pagination for chat history
- Expand test coverage with integration and E2E tests
- Add more advanced performance optimizations
