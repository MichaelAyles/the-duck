## 🚨 CRITICAL CLEANUP REQUIRED

### 1. **Code Quality Issues** (ESLint Failures)
- **16 ESLint errors** need fixing before transfer
- Unused imports and variables across multiple files
- TypeScript `any` types need proper typing
- Missing React dependency warnings

### 2. **Build Issues**
- Build warnings from Supabase dependencies
- Trace file permission errors on Windows
- Need to resolve for production deployment

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- Missing `.env.local` file for development
- Environment variables scattered across files
- Need centralized configuration documentation

### 4. **Database Setup**
- Drizzle schema doesn't match Supabase migration
- Inconsistent table structure between migrations
- Need to reconcile PostgreSQL schema

### 5. **Project Identity**
- Currently branded as "Aura Chat" but transitioning to "The Duck"
- Package.json already named "the-duck" but components still reference old branding
- Need consistent branding throughout
