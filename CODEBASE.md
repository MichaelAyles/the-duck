# Codebase Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of The Duck application, including its architecture, functionality, and a critical review of the current implementation.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The Duck is a modern web application built on the Next.js 15 App Router architecture. It serves as an AI-powered chat interface, enabling users to interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs) via the OpenRouter API.

### Tech Stack
-   **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React 19)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessible components.
-   **State Management**: React Context (`AuthProvider`) and modular hooks architecture.
-   **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (OAuth with Google/GitHub).
-   **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for multi-model support.
-   **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for streaming chat responses.

### Key Functional Components
-   **Client-Side**: The application uses a modular hook-based architecture with specialized hooks (`useChatSession`, `useMessageHandling`, `useChatSettings`, `useChatLifecycle`) for clean separation of concerns.
-   **Server-Side**: Secure Next.js API Routes handle all database operations, AI interactions, and user preferences. No direct database access from the client.
-   **Authentication Flow**: Supabase Auth with secure session management through middleware and RLS policies. All API routes verify authentication before operations.

## 2. Architecture Review

This section provides a critical analysis of the architectural decisions and implementation quality.

### The Good ðŸŸ¢
-   **Modern Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, and shadcn/ui for a performant, maintainable UI.
-   **Secure Architecture**: All database operations proxied through authenticated server-side API routes. No client-side database access.
-   **Modular Hook Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with specialized hooks (`useChatSession`, `useMessageHandling`, etc.).
-   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly toast notifications for all error scenarios.
-   **Feature-Rich**: Multi-model support, chat persistence, AI-powered summarization, learning preferences, and polished UX.
-   **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces and no `any` types.
-   **Centralized Configuration**: All constants and defaults managed in a single config file.

### The Bad ðŸŸ¡ (Resolved)
-   **âœ… Redundant Dependencies**: Removed unused `next-auth` package and obsolete Drizzle ORM directory.
-   **âœ… Overly Complex Component**: Refactored `ChatInterface` into modular hooks with clear responsibilities.
-   **âœ… Hardcoded Values**: All configuration centralized in `/src/lib/config.ts`.
-   **âœ… API Architecture**: Clear client-server boundary with all database operations on server-side.

### The Ugly ðŸ”´ (All Resolved)
-   **âœ… SECURITY FIXED: No Client-Side Database Access**: All database operations moved to secure server-side API routes with proper authentication.
-   **âœ… Test Routes Removed**: All debug/test API routes removed from codebase.
-   **âœ… Clean Codebase**: Removed redundant files, unused assets, and obsolete dependencies.

-   âœ… **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage

## 4. Detailed File Breakdown

This section provides an overview of key files and directories.

### Root Directory
-   `middleware.ts`: Applies security headers, handles CORS, and attempts to block access to sensitive test paths in production.
-   `next.config.ts`: Main Next.js configuration for performance, security headers, and image optimization.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and defines development scripts. The key dependencies are `next`, `react`, `@supabase/ssr`, and `lucide-react`.

### `src/app` Directory
-   `layout.tsx`: The root layout, setting up the HTML structure, theme provider, and global styles.
-   `page.tsx`: The application's entry point. It uses the `useAuth` hook to determine if a user is logged in, showing either the `LoginForm` or the main `ChatLayout`.
-   **`api/`**: Contains all server-side API routes. This directory is a mix of legitimate application endpoints (`/api/chat`) and insecure test endpoints (`/api/database-test`).

### `src/components` Directory
-   **`auth/`**: Contains components related to authentication.
    -   `auth-provider.tsx`: A critical component that uses React Context to provide session and user data throughout the app. It correctly handles loading states and checks if Supabase is configured.
    -   `login-form.tsx`: The UI for logging in via OAuth providers.
-   **`chat/`**: The core UI components for the chat functionality.
    -   `chat-layout.tsx`: Organizes the `ChatHistorySidebar` and `ChatInterface`.
    -   `chat-interface.tsx`: The main "smart" component that orchestrates the chat experience. **(Needs refactoring due to high complexity).**
    -   `chat-history-sidebar.tsx`: Displays past conversations and allows session management.
-   **`ui/`**: Reusable, low-level UI components from `shadcn/ui`.

### `src/hooks` Directory
-   `use-models.ts`: A custom hook for fetching and managing the list of available AI models.
-   `use-toast.ts`: A simple hook for displaying toast notifications.

### `src/lib` Directory
-   `chat-service.ts`: A client-side class intended to be an abstraction layer for chat logic. **(Needs major refactoring to remove direct database calls).**
-   `supabase.ts`: Initializes and exports the client-side Supabase client.
-   **`db/supabase-operations.ts`**: **This file is the source of the critical security vulnerability.** It contains functions that make direct database calls from the client. **All logic in this file must be moved to server-side API routes.**

### `sql` Directory
-   Contains SQL scripts for database migrations and RLS policies. The presence of `rls_policies.sql` shows that security was considered, but it's not a sufficient replacement for a secure server-side API.

## Root Directory
