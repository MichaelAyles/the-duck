# Codebase Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of The Duck application, including its architecture, functionality, and a critical review of the current implementation.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The Duck is a modern web application built on the Next.js 15 App Router architecture. It serves as an AI-powered chat interface, enabling users to interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs) via the OpenRouter API.

### Tech Stack
-   **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React 19)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessible components.
-   **State Management**: React Context (`AuthProvider`) and component-level state.
-   **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (OAuth with Google/GitHub).
-   **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for multi-model support.

### Key Functional Components
-   **Client-Side**: The application is primarily a single-page application (SPA) centered around the `ChatInterface` component. It manages chat state, user settings, and session history.
-   **Server-Side**: The backend consists of numerous Next.js API Routes (`src/app/api`) that handle tasks like streaming chat responses, generating titles, and fetching AI models.
-   **Authentication Flow**: Authentication is handled by Supabase. A client-side `AuthProvider` manages the user session, and an OAuth callback route (`/auth/callback/route.ts`) finalizes the login process.

## 2. Architecture Review

This section provides a critical analysis of the architectural decisions and implementation quality.

### The Good ðŸŸ¢
-   **Modern Frontend**: The use of Next.js with the App Router, React 19, and shadcn/ui results in a modern, performant, and maintainable user interface.
-   **Well-Structured UI Components**: The React components in `src/components` are well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns (e.g., `ChatLayout`, `ChatInterface`, `ChatMessages`).
-   **Solid Authentication**: The implementation of Supabase Auth via the `AuthProvider` context is robust, providing a clean way to manage user sessions across the application. The `isConfigured` flag for handling unconfigured Supabase environments is a thoughtful touch for development.
-   **Feature-Rich**: The application boasts an impressive set of features, including multi-model support, chat persistence, AI-powered summarization, and a polished user experience.

### The Bad ðŸŸ¡
-   **Redundant Dependencies**: The project includes `next-auth` as a dependency, but all authentication logic is handled by `@supabase/ssr` and the custom `AuthProvider`. This adds unnecessary bloat and potential confusion.
-   **Overly Complex Component**: The `ChatInterface` component has become overly complex, managing numerous pieces of state and side effects through a tangle of `useEffect` hooks. This makes it difficult to reason about and prone to bugs.
-   **Hardcoded Values**: There are several hardcoded values, such as the default AI model in `ChatInterface.tsx`, which should be configurable or dynamically fetched.
-   **Lack of Centralized API Logic**: The client-side `ChatService` attempts to be an abstraction layer, but its responsibilities are blurred. It mixes API calls (`fetch`) with direct calls to a database service, leading to architectural inconsistency.

### The Ugly ðŸ”´ (Critical Issues)
-   **CRITICAL SECURITY RISK: Direct Client-Side Database Access**: The most significant issue is that the application performs direct database operations from the client-side. The `ChatService`, which runs in the browser, imports and uses `DatabaseService` (`supabase-operations.ts`). This service makes raw Supabase calls (`upsert`, `select`, `delete`) directly from the client.
    -   **Why this is critical**: This architecture exposes your entire database schema and logic to the client. While Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) is used as a safeguard, relying solely on RLS for security is extremely risky. Any misconfiguration in RLS policies could lead to a severe data breach, allowing malicious users to access, modify, or delete other users' data.
    -   **Best Practice**: Client-side applications should **NEVER** contain direct database queries. All database interactions must be proxied through secure, server-side API endpoints that validate user authentication, authorization, and input.
-   **Test Routes in Production**: The codebase contains numerous API routes for testing and debugging purposes (e.g., `/api/database-test`, `/api/security-test`, `/api/debug`). While the middleware attempts to block these, their very existence in the codebase is a security liability. They should be removed entirely from the production build.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Refactor All Database Operations**: **This is the highest priority.** All functions within `supabase-operations.ts` must be moved to the server side.
    -   Create new, secure API endpoints for every database operation (e.g., `POST /api/chat`, `GET /api/chat/[sessionId]`, `DELETE /api/chat/[sessionId]`).
    -   The client-side `ChatService` should be refactored to **only** make `fetch` calls to these new API endpoints. It should contain no `import` statements from `@/lib/db`.
    -   This change will properly secure the application and create a clear, maintainable client-server boundary.
2.  **Clean Up API Routes**: Remove all test, debug, and unused API routes from the `src/app/api` directory.
3.  **Simplify `ChatInterface`**: Refactor the `ChatInterface` component. Consider moving complex logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useSessionManager`, `useChatGenerator`) to better separate concerns and reduce the number of `useEffect` hooks.
4.  **Remove `next-auth`**: Since it is unused, remove the `next-auth` package to clean up dependencies (`npm uninstall next-auth`).
5.  **Centralize Configuration**: Move hardcoded values like the default model name into a centralized configuration file or fetch them from a user preferences endpoint.

## 4. Detailed File Breakdown

This section provides an overview of key files and directories.

### Root Directory
-   `middleware.ts`: Applies security headers, handles CORS, and attempts to block access to sensitive test paths in production.
-   `next.config.ts`: Main Next.js configuration for performance, security headers, and image optimization.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and defines development scripts. The key dependencies are `next`, `react`, `@supabase/ssr`, and `lucide-react`.

### `src/app` Directory
-   `layout.tsx`: The root layout, setting up the HTML structure, theme provider, and global styles.
-   `page.tsx`: The application's entry point. It uses the `useAuth` hook to determine if a user is logged in, showing either the `LoginForm` or the main `ChatLayout`.
-   **`api/`**: Contains all server-side API routes. This directory is a mix of legitimate application endpoints (`/api/chat`) and insecure test endpoints (`/api/database-test`).

### `src/components` Directory
-   **`auth/`**: Contains components related to authentication.
    -   `auth-provider.tsx`: A critical component that uses React Context to provide session and user data throughout the app. It correctly handles loading states and checks if Supabase is configured.
    -   `login-form.tsx`: The UI for logging in via OAuth providers.
-   **`chat/`**: The core UI components for the chat functionality.
    -   `chat-layout.tsx`: Organizes the `ChatHistorySidebar` and `ChatInterface`.
    -   `chat-interface.tsx`: The main "smart" component that orchestrates the chat experience. **(Needs refactoring due to high complexity).**
    -   `chat-history-sidebar.tsx`: Displays past conversations and allows session management.
-   **`ui/`**: Reusable, low-level UI components from `shadcn/ui`.

### `src/hooks` Directory
-   `use-models.ts`: A custom hook for fetching and managing the list of available AI models.
-   `use-toast.ts`: A simple hook for displaying toast notifications.

### `src/lib` Directory
